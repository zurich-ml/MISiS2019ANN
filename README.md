# MISiS2019ANN
Neural Network introduction at MISiS (Moscow)

## Preparing for the Tutorials

 - Follow the steps below to setup the Ipython notebook
 - Run the first lines, including the line starting with the `!wget` command and the `!git clone` command. This will download the data and allow you to import utils.py in the notebook.
 - Make sure this worked and report if any troubles arise
 
If you prefer, you can also run it locally or on the machine of your choice. Feel free to download the notebooks, data and setup the right environment (there is an anaconda environment included in the repo).

## Google Colab Setup

In order to run the tutorials, it is recommended to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
Open the link (if needed log yourself in) and select the tab "Github". There, search for "zurich-ml/MISiS2019ANN"
and two Ipython Notebooks should show up. Click on them and the notebook will open.

### Using a GPU

In order to speed up training, we can even use GPUs! Select on "Runtime"->"Change Runtime Type" and then select the "Hardware Accelerator" to be a GPU. Connect again in case it does not do automatically.

## Data

The data is stored in a cloud and can be accessed via:

 - https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/8vpC3MgmpohQ5tN/download for the first tutorial on feedforward networks
 - https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/xcLDFKJAyyZGmfD/download for the second tutorial on convolutional networks
 
You don't have to download the data directly but it's done automatically in the notebook.
