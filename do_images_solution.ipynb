    "In this tutorial, we will build a convolutional neural network. It is the second tutorial and contains a little less prewritten function calls i.e. to display the loss or to plot the roc. Use your knowledge from the first notebook and plot anything of interest!\n",

    "### What are CNNs?\n",
    "Compared to normal feedforward networks, convolutional neural networks are especially performant to deal with images, since in this case we usually have:\n",

    " - the **spatial position _matters_**: We would not recognize an image whose pixels are randomly shuffled!\n",

    "Convolution neural networks deal with this by using local information from several neighbouring nodes to learn about the problem."

    "## Convolutional Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a convolutional layer is a filter/kernel (\"mini image\" consisting of 3x3 - 5x5 pixels) which scans over the whole image and returns a value at each position proportional to \"how well the mini image fits in this subset of pixels\". This, the how-well-it-fits, is the output of a convolutional layer, a \"feature map\". So for example, if the filter is a horizontal line but the subset of pixels is a vertical line, the output would be small, whereas if the subset were a horizontal line as well, the output would be large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below animation illustrates this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/convolution_animation.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a slightly more extended introduction and visualization see [here](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/a-friendly-introduction-to-convolutional-neural-networks#convolution-layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial difference to the dense layer of (2 dimensional) convolutional layers is that their input is not a flat 1-D Tensor as before but a 2-D Tensor (it's an image in the end and, remember the spatial correlation that matters, we want to keep it as that). There are also 1 and 3 (and in principle N) dimensional convolutional layers (with 1-D or 3-D inputs respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we will need to change two things in our network compared to the previous tutorial:\n",
    " - the input shape is different\n",
    " - since our output layer is 1-D, we need to flatten the 2-D structure somewhere\n",
    " \n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "To create a convolutional layer in Keras, the syntax looks like this:\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "keras.layers.Conv2D(number_of_filters, size_of_the_filter, activation_function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where the number of filters controls the \"depth\" of the representation and the size of the filter (`kernel_size`) specifies the shape of the filter. A more detailed explanation can be found in the [keras convolutional layer docs](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/) (make sure to scroll down to the Conv2D, not the Conv1D).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**:\n",
    "Add an additional hidden convolutional layer with 64 filters and a kernel size of 3 (and 'tanh' activation). Train it afterwards."

    "As we've noticed, the accuracy of the network did not increase with the epochs. But given the huge number of nodes, this does not really come in as a big surprise. On the other hand, we actually don't need _all_ of the pixels to get information from an image and we somehow should compress the image. The common way to do that is to do pooling. In simple terms, this is a downsampling by combining several (4-20 neighbouring) nodes (\"pixels\") to one. There are several ways of combining the nodes like taking the average of all nodes or the maximum.\n",
